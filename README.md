# check-with-gemini
A very simple MCP server that enables MCP hosts to check things with gemini-cli. Intended mainly to be used with Claude Code.

## How to use with Claude Code

You will need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed.

Then simply do:

`claude mcp add check_with_gemini uv run /path/to/check_with_gemini.py`

and then start claude. You can now ask Claude Code to check things with Gemini and it will.
